1. How does garbage collector work?
->All objects are allocated on the heap area managed by the JVM.  As long as an object is being referenced[the variable or pointer is in stack], the JVM considers it alive. Once an object is no
   longer referenced and therefore is not reachable by the application code, the garbage collector removes  removes the unreferenced objects from heap memory and reclaims the unused memory. 


2. Algo used in Garbage Collector
 -> The Mark-Sweep algorithm is the most common garbage collection algorithm, which performs two operations. It first marks the objects to be garbage-collected in the memory space and 
      then clears the marked objects up from the heap.


3. Query of transaction

 -> 
 -- 1. start a new transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- 2. Get the latest order number
SELECT 
    @orderNumber:=MAX(orderNUmber)+1
FROM
    orders;

-- 3. insert a new order for customer 145
INSERT INTO orders(orderNumber,
                   orderDate,
                   requiredDate,
                   shippedDate,
                   status,
                   customerNumber)
VALUES(@orderNumber,
       '2005-05-31',
       '2005-06-10',
       '2005-06-11',
       'In Process',
        145);
        
-- 4. Insert order line items
INSERT INTO orderdetails(orderNumber,
                         productCode,
                         quantityOrdered,
                         priceEach,
                         orderLineNumber)
VALUES(@orderNumber,'S18_1749', 30, '136', 1),
      (@orderNumber,'S18_2248', 50, '55.09', 2); 
      
-- 5. commit changes    
COMMIT;
