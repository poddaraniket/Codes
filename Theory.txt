2.What is Semaphore, mutex
3.Difference between mutex and semaphore and why we need this.
4.Can we make a shared variable among threads of the same process and different process? [yes but apply lock to avoid critical section problem]
5.what is Dynamic linking
6.Whats is Constructor and Destructor along with its code
7.Why do we need Destructor?
8.what is a memory leak?
->A memory leak is an unintentional form of memory consumption whereby the developer fails to free an allocated block of memory when no longer needed
9.How do we manage two different processes?[context switching]
10.What is interprocess Synchornisation?  [Interprocess communication is based on the use of shared variabless]
11.What is Functor in C++?
-> function wrapped in a class so that it can be availabble like an object 
    [sort(a,a+n,greater<int>()); greater<int>() -> functor]

25.What is the role of destructor? And when shall it be used?
26.Difference between abstraction and encapsulation? Give an example of explaining the same?
27.VTABLE and VPTR(Run-time Polymorphism)
-> vTable: is a kind of function pointer array that contains the addresses all virtual functions of this class. Compiler builds this vTable at compile time. 
    vPointer: Now for every object of a class that has a vTable associated with it, contains a vPointer in first 4 bytes. This vPointer points to the vTable of that class
28.difference between process and thread
29.What is the difference between multiprocessing and multithreading?
30. Benefits of multithreading?
31 How does a process calls another process in Operating system? [System Calls]
32 Describe IPC in detail.
33 This comprised of 4 different situations on using multiple or single processor in OS with the benefits of multiprocessing and multithreading.
